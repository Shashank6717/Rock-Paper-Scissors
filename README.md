# Rock Paper Scissors Game 🎮

A fun and interactive Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This was my first JavaScript project, and I had a blast creating it while learning the basics of web development.

## 🌟 Features

- **Classic Mode**: Play the traditional Rock Paper Scissors game
- **Best of 3 Mode**: Challenge yourself to win 2 out of 3 rounds
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient background with smooth animations
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded messages and animations for wins, losses, and draws
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your wins against the computer
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Choose between Classic or Best of 3 mode
2. Click on Rock, Paper, or Scissors to make your choice
3. See who wins each round!
4. In Best of 3 mode, first to win 2 rounds is the champion
5. Use the Reset button to start a new game anytime

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with modern features like Flexbox and CSS Grid)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Font Awesome for icons

## 🚀 Learning Experience

This project was my first dive into JavaScript and CSS! I learned so much while building it:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- CSS animations and transitions
- Responsive design principles
- Game logic implementation
- State management basics

The most exciting part was seeing how JavaScript could make the game interactive and how CSS could make it look beautiful. I experimented with different styles and animations to make it engaging and fun to play.

## 🎨 Design Choices

I wanted to create something that looked modern and professional while being simple to use. The dark theme with gradient background gives it a sleek look, and the circular design for the game choices makes it visually appealing. The hover effects and animations make the game feel more dynamic and engaging.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

While this is a complete game, here are some ideas for future enhancements:

- Add multiplayer functionality
- Include sound effects
- Add more game modes
- Create a leaderboard
- Add more animations and visual effects
